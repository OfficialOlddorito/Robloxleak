From months ago we found Roblox hidden developer scripts, In the future from `Reverse Engineering` We would create a possible `Fe Bypass` and can make Lua scripts undetectable around winter!
We successfully restored the scripts somewhere before revealing some small snippets to the public. We also have hidden apis, panels, and more which would possibly be revealed or on sale in about a year. (not sure)
Though we do have many methods of having scripts **Server-sided** in which we would test over 200 scripts from our team to check if a script would have the vulnerability to bypass or adjust `Security Measurements` in a game expereince client as we have signal changers to change on how the overall client would act, so basically a script would seem like Roblox is in 2016 again and could cause chaos!1!1!!
